# Description
The Overwatch landing page is the first landing page project that I ever created and it was mainly to practice different kinds of parallax effect to create a 3D depth effect. I have not yet made any significant changes since I built it but I plan on updating in the future possibly with an API that provides Overwatch data and custom animations for heroes apperance.

# Key features
- Multi-layer horizontal paralax for the top hero battle scene paired with looped video of floating particles. 
- Parallax scrolling for the section preceding the footer.
- Hero selector showcasing new hero in the same section of the website once the user selects it implemented with JS.
- Looped CSS animation for the videogame boxes appearing on the initial screen "buy the game" button.
- Find me a hero quiz accessible through the button at the bottom of the page, made with a combination of JS prompt and alerts.
- Responsiveness. Works on any screen.
